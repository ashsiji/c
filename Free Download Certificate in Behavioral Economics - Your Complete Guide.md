## What is Behavioral Economics?

Traditional economics assumes that people are rational actors who always make optimal decisions. Behavioral economics, on the other hand, recognizes that humans are often driven by emotions, biases, and cognitive limitations. It applies psychological insights to understand how people actually make choices. This leads to a more realistic and practical understanding of economic behavior.

**Key concepts in behavioral economics include:**

*   **Cognitive biases:** Systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Examples include confirmation bias (seeking information that confirms existing beliefs) and anchoring bias (relying too heavily on the first piece of information received).
*   **Heuristics:** Mental shortcuts that people use to make decisions quickly. While helpful in many situations, heuristics can also lead to errors in judgment.
*   **Framing effects:** The way in which information is presented can significantly influence choices. For example, people are more likely to choose a product described as "90% fat-free" than one described as "10% fat."
*   **Loss aversion:** The tendency to feel the pain of a loss more strongly than the pleasure of an equivalent gain.
*   **Prospect theory:** A behavioral economic theory that describes how people make decisions when faced with risk and uncertainty.
