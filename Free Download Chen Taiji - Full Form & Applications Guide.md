## Understanding Chen Taiji: The Original Style

Chen Taiji is considered the oldest and parent form of all Taijiquan styles. Unlike other styles that emphasize slow, flowing movements, Chen Taiji incorporates explosive power (fajin), fast and slow speeds, and spiraling motions. This makes it a dynamic and effective martial art, as well as a health-promoting exercise.

**Key Characteristics of Chen Taiji:**

*   **Spiraling Movements:** These are crucial for generating power and connecting the entire body.
*   **Fast and Slow Rhythms:** Transitions between slow, meditative movements and bursts of speed are characteristic of Chen style.
*   **Fajin (Emitted Power):** The ability to release concentrated power from the entire body.
*   **Chan Si Gong (Silk Reeling Energy):** This refers to the continuous, coiling energy that flows throughout the body.
*   **Low Stances:** Chen Taiji often involves lower stances than other styles, building leg strength and stability.
