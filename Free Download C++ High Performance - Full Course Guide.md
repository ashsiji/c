*   **Templates and Generic Programming:** C++ templates provide a powerful mechanism for writing generic algorithms and data structures that can operate on various data types without sacrificing performance.
*   **Libraries and Frameworks:** A vast ecosystem of C++ libraries and frameworks, such as Boost, Eigen, and CUDA, are specifically designed for high-performance computing tasks.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** C++ code can be compiled and run on a wide range of platforms, from embedded systems to supercomputers.
*   **Direct Memory Access:** C++ offers direct memory manipulation, crucial for optimizing data layout and minimizing memory access overhead.
