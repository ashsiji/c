## Why Care Management Training is Essential

Care management is a rapidly growing field, driven by an aging population and increasing demand for personalized healthcare services. Care managers play a vital role in coordinating and overseeing the care of individuals with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or age-related needs. Effective care management requires a diverse skillset, including:

*   **Assessment Skills:** Evaluating a client's physical, emotional, and social needs.
