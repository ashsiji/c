## Understanding the Power of Calendly Webhooks

Calendly is a powerful scheduling tool used by individuals and businesses alike. But its true potential is unlocked when integrated with other systems using webhooks. Webhooks are essentially real-time notifications triggered by events within Calendly. Instead of constantly polling Calendly's API for updates, your application receives a push notification whenever something important happens, such as a new event being scheduled, cancelled, or rescheduled. This enables automation, streamlines workflows, and ensures that your systems are always in sync with Calendly.

This means you can automatically update your CRM when a meeting is booked, trigger an email sequence when an event is cancelled, or even automatically add attendees to a webinar platform. The possibilities are virtually limitless.
