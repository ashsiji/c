## What is a Certified Quality Manager (CQM)?

A **Certified Quality Manager (CQM)** is a professional who leads and champions process improvement initiatives â€“ large and small â€“ that create a **quality-focused culture**. They manage, and continuously improve, the processes within an organization to ensure that products, services, and systems meet or exceed customer expectations.
