## Understanding the Allure of Celtic Knots

Celtic knots are more than just pretty pictures; they are a profound symbol of eternity, interconnectedness, and the cyclical nature of life. Originating in the British Isles during the Celtic and early Christian periods, these intricate interlaced designs have found their way into various art forms, including jewelry, tattoos, architecture, and graphic design. Their timeless appeal lies in their complexity, symbolism, and sheer visual beauty.

**Key Characteristics of Celtic Knots:**

*   **Interlaced Lines:** The defining feature of Celtic knots is the continuous interlacing of lines, with no beginning or end. This represents eternity and the interconnectedness of all things.
*   **Symmetry:** Many Celtic knots exhibit symmetry, either radial or bilateral, adding to their visual harmony.
